    ## Description
    Motivation for this project was to work on my understanding of node js and the inquirer package.

    This projects makes it so README files are much more easily created.

    I learned much about node js as well as the cutomization and formattting of readme files.

    ## Installation
    To install this project you will need to download my github repo, run it on vs code, download the inquirer package from the package.json, and then run node index.js in your terminal.

    ## Usage
    Once installed, you run node index.js and then answer all the prompted questions.

    ## License
    I used a MIT license.

    ## Contributing
    You can contribute by downloading the github repo and adding to it as the repo is publicly open.
    
    ## Tests
    I tested it by running it over and over again in my terminal until it worked properly.
