## Description
Motivation for this project was to work on my understanding of Node.js and the Inquirer package.

This project makes it so README files are much more easily created.

I learned much about Node.js as well as the customization and formatting of README files.

## Installation
To install this project, you will need to download my GitHub repo, run it on VS Code, download the Inquirer package from the package.json, and then run `node index.js` in your terminal.

## Usage
Once installed, you run `node index.js` and then answer all the prompted questions.

## License
I used an MIT license.

## Contributing
You can contribute by downloading the GitHub repo and adding to it, as the repo is publicly open.

## Tests
I tested it by running it over and over again in my terminal until it worked properly.
